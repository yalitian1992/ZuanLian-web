            Through the Diamond Financial Engine, Zuanlian Tech creates China’s first electronic physically settled diamond exchange platform with global prices linkage mechanism (“Zuanlian-Exchange Platform” or “Platform”). This platform provides consumers with a channel to purchase diamonds with international first-hand prices, provides jewelers with the price guidance based on high liquidity and a trading place, and provides investors with a brand new financial asset class.

                        Each diamond issued by Zuanlian techn is graded and certified by GIA or NGTC and is packaged in sealed container to meet the GIA or NGTC standards. After inspection by the Exchange, the diamonds will be stored in the high security level vult recognized by both Zuanlian Tech and the Exchange. Furthermore, both parties will send staff to regulate the diamonds to ensure the security 100%.

                            Diamond is born with uniqueness and indivisibility, and as a result, there are tens of millions of various diamonds in the world. This has hindered diamonds to be a standardized investment class. Zuanlian Tech innovates the "diamond matrix" which solves the standardization problem of diamonds with standardized contracts, and hence overcomes one of the biggest obstacles of the liquidity of diamonds. Afterwards, investors can invest and trade diamonds asset via the the standardized contracts of diamonds.

                        <dd>
                            Since standardization issues are resolved, large number of variable diamonds becomes tradable in Exchanges as a standard asset class. Diamonds are no longer a mere consumer goods, and become truly valuable and good liquid modern asset class.

                        <dd>
                            Liquidity doesn't mean virtual assets. By contrast, what issued by Zuanlian Tech are real diamonds. Each standardized contract on the platform corresponds a real diamond. Users who hold the contracts can withdraw the corresponding diamonds anytime.

                            Generally, assets lacks of liquidity don’t have fair prices. Diamonds, however, will have fair prices based on abundant liquidity after Zuanlian Tech solves the problem of liquidity of diamonds. Then investors can buy or sell diamond assets with real time price on the Platform.

Meanwhile, through advanced diamond financial engine and private placement mechanism in the Exchanges, the prices of diamond assets in China will be synchronized with the international market, which will avoid over-speculation in China market.<br>

                            Due to various reasons, retail prices of diamond are 3~4 times higher than wholesale prices. Through the diamond financial engine, Zuanlian Tech connects source of diamond trade and private investment, which not only provides jewelers with the price guidance based on high liquidity and a trading place, but offers consumers a channel to purchase diamonds with international first-hand prices.

                    <p>
                        When investors invest diamond assets by holding the standardization contract of diamond on the Platform, they not only earn the expected appreciation of diamond assets, but can withdraw the real diamonds and enjoy the goodness of diamonds themselves if the market goes downturn unexpected. This is a remarkable advantage that other kinds of assets such as securities (e.g. stocks), precious metals or other commodities (e.g. soybeans and oil) can not be compared. Therefore, investors truly realizes the anti-risk purpose by investing diamond assets on the Platform because they can make profit out of the diamond assets, or hold the physical assets otherwise.
